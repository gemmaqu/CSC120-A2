What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

start as early as you can. TA hours really helped a lot. I think learning Java ahead of time would be a good option, you don't need to master it. But having a basic understanding of its structure and usage can be really helpful.
And according to the comments professor gave me last time. I find it's necessary to pay attention to details. For example my mistake last time, I can't use index to check whether the computer is in inventory. If I do that, there's will always have computer in that index in inventory, but different it_id. Therefore, I change it to search for item_id instead of the index of item_id.
